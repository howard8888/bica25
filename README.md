Repository to hold source code for paper associated with BICA 2025 conference


Note: May 2025 -- I have ended up using GitHub for a convenient source to store various papers so they can easily be accessed by others, as noted by the various papers in this repository, i.e., not just the 2017 Review and Psychopharmacological Treatment of Insomnia presentation but the current collection of papers/presentations/code snippets. (Much of other code is not here but on a local Git system -- please contact me directly for access to any particular code.)
